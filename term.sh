A CDN (Content Delivery Network) — a system of servers placed all over the world that help get video content to people quickly.

A CDN caches content closer to users, so when someone in Japan watches a U.S. video, it loads from a nearby server instead of across the ocean.

Think of a CDN like a delivery truck depot—instead of sending one truck from far away, it uses a local one to deliver your content fast.

CDNs reduce latency, which means faster loading times, fewer buffering wheels, and a better experience for users worldwide.

CDNs distribute traffic across multiple servers, so no single location gets overwhelmed during a viral moment.

Even static assets like images, JavaScript, and CSS can be cached by CDNs, speeding up websites dramatically.

Security boost: Many CDNs offer DDoS protection and serve content over HTTPS, helping keep sites safe and secure.
